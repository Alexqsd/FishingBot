Fishing Bot

This is a program designed to automate the Fishing skill in World of Warcraft. The program uses pixel recognition to detect the fishing bobber, then it proceeds to scan around the bobber ~8 times a second a determines a 'score' for the level of blue in the frame. If the difference of blue changes from its' orignal state to a high degree, the program will click the bobber and attempt to loot the fish.

Instructions: 

* Ensure Java is up to date.
* Run "FishingBot.jar"

Necessary considerations before using:

* Requires Java 8 or above.
* Before each use, make sure to calibrate the program. To do this, click the 'Calibrate' button and then immediately hover over the Bobber after having casted the Fishing Pole. If done correctly, the mouse will move to the location of the pixel that it will use as reference for when the mouse is over the bobber.
* World of Warcraft must be on your primary monitor, and should be full screen or windowed full screen. The program must see the 'Fishing Bobber' tooltip in the bottom right hand corner, and as such it specifically looks in the right hand corner. If there is nothing there, except a desktop screen, the calibration will fail.
* It is highly recommended that you zoom in on your character before running the Fishing Mode to prevent false positivies. 
* You must have your fishing pole equipped before running the program.
* You must have the fishing skill before running the program.
* Your camera and character should be facing the same direction to ensure that the bobber-finder can locate the bobber correctly.
* Make sure you did not disable tooltips in the World of Warcraft menu before running this program.
* Try not to have full bags as it will impede the ability of the program to loot and continue fishing.

Features needed:

* Lure attachment support
* Ban safety
* Timer set by user to quit on

Notes: 

* This program should work on all versions of World of Warcraft. 
* See the video attached for more information.
